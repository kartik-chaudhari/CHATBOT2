The chatterbot : Pratima understands the sentence you enter by categorising it word by word into segments like :Question, object, emotion, etc.  Each is categorized and linked in a sequence. The input is then first matched with the most frequent inputs from users (statements like hi , how are you ie: most commonly occuring statements are stored seperately and the input is first matched with these values). if not found, then the words linked words create responses based on the linking of words present in the adjacency matrix is linked to and finds answers based on the structure of the input . This behaves like an adaptation of a neural network .
